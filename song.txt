I am like an albatross I fly over the sea
I don't need a home I don't need one
You are like an albatross when you met me
You said you will always need me
If only we could hear what they're telling us every day
Don't think. Feel
If only we could hear what they're telling us every day
The thinking kills the feeling
If only our ears would understand what they say
Thinking kills the feeling
I am like an albatross all the humans that exist
I don't need to see them
And everyone almost everyone I ever met
Doesn't understand me
